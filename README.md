# NIFTY Scalping Bot

An automated **NIFTY50 Options Scalping Bot** built using [Fyers API](https://myapi.fyers.in/docs/) (WebSocket + REST).

## üöÄ Features
- Fetches historical and live data using Fyers API.

- Scalping strategy with CE/PE entries and exits.
- Cooldown logic to prevent over-trading.
- Trade logs stored in CSV.
- ‚úÖ **Paper Trading Only** (no live orders are placed).
